# Latent-semantic-indexing
Latent semantic indexing is based on Single value decomposition for information filtering 
A matrix containing word counts per paragraph (rows represent unique words and columns represent each paragraph) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns.
